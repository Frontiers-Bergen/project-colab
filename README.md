### Development
#### Branch naming
* lowercase and hyphen inplace of space. For example `feature/landingpage`
* Only alphanumeric characters, dont use period, space, underscores etc. and dont use multiple hyphens after another, or trailing hyphens.

1. `feature/` for all features.
2. `bugfix/` for all bugfixes.
3. `hotfix/` for all quick emergency fixes.
4. `docs/` for udates to documentation.
5. `refactor/` for refactoring.

#### Commit messages
* all commit messages should be short (50 characters or less), but descriptive. Example `feat: add admin dashboard`. The description should also be what the commit does, not what you did. Notice the example above said `add` not `added`
* We use the following prefixes:
  * `feat:` for features
  * `style:` everything styling related
  * `fix:` for bugfixes and hotfixes
  * `docs:` for ducumentaion
  * `refactor:` for refactoring
